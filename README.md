# Positive Message Generator

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates a random positive message using a collection of quotes, affirmations, and words.

## Installation

2) Open the project directory in your terminal or command prompt
3) Run npm install to install any necessary dependencies

## Usage
1) Open index.js file in your text editor
2) Modify the arrays in the store object to add or remove quotes, affirmations, and words as needed
3) Save the changes
4) Run node index.js in your terminal or command prompt to generate a random positive message

## Functionality
This program utilizes the `randomPicker` function to select a random word, quote, and affirmation from the `store` object. These three elements are then concatenated into a single string using template literals, and displayed in the console using `console.log()`.
